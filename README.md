 - 1 User Authentication
      - Dataset: User authentication events. Each time a user logs into a computer (or even possible business applications) an event is created capturing the time, user, and computer that the event occurred on. 
      - Approach: Use unsupervised learning (K-means) to try and group users based on their behaviors. 
 
 - 2 Sentiment Analysis
      - Dataset: Pulling tweets directly from Twitter using their API.
      - Approach: Clean up the tweet text & use a labeled dataset (from Kaggle.com) to perform sentiment analysis, identifying which tweets have a positve or negative sentiment related to COVID-19. Then create a clout score for each tweet and plot on a map of the U.S. using the Twitter user's location.
