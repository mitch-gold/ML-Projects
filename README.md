# Projects

 - 1 User Authentication
      - **Dataset**: User authentication events. Each time a user logs into a computer (or even possible business applications) an event is created capturing the time, user, and computer that the event occurred on. 
      - **Approach**: Use unsupervised learning (K-means) to try and group users based on their behaviors. 
 
 - 2 Sentiment Analysis
      - **Dataset**: Pulling tweets directly from Twitter using their API.
      - **Approach**: Clean up the tweet text & use a labeled dataset (from Kaggle.com) to perform sentiment analysis, identifying which tweets have a positve or negative sentiment related to COVID-19. Then create a clout score for each tweet and plot on a map of the U.S. using the Twitter user's location.

 - 3 Heart Disease Prediction
      - **Dataset**: From https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
      - **Approach**: Use a (mostly) ready-to-go dataset with heart disease indicators and target. Showcase several supervised learning techniques and explain some advantages/disadvantages. Create a function to use in a real-world scenario to help a cadiology specialist's office workflow.
