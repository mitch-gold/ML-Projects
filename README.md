# Projects

 - 1 User Authentication
 
      - **Dataset**: User authentication events. Each time a user logs into a computer (or even possible business applications) an event is created capturing the time, user, and computer that the event occurred on. 
      - **Approach**: Use unsupervised learning (K-means) to try and group users based on their behaviors. 
 
 - 2 Sentiment Analysis
 
      - **Dataset**: Pulling tweets directly from Twitter using their API.
      - **Approach**: Clean up the tweet text & use a labeled dataset (from Kaggle.com) to perform sentiment analysis, identifying which tweets have a positve or negative sentiment related to COVID-19. Then create a clout score for each tweet and plot on a map of the U.S. using the Twitter user's location.

 - 3 Heart Disease Prediction
 
      - **Dataset**: From https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
      - **Approach**: Use a (mostly) ready-to-go dataset with heart disease indicators and target. Showcase several supervised learning techniques and explain some advantages/disadvantages. Create a function to use in a real-world scenario to help a cadiology specialist's office workflow.
      
- 4 Network Visualization & Risk Classification

     - **Dataset**: From https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps
     - **Approach**: Use netflow data to cluster nodes by daily aggregates. Visualize network structure with NetworkX package, and highlight the nodes by clusters. Identify nodes that would be prioritized for security hardening and remediation.
